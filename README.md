## Environments

### Main Branch

The main branch is the production-ready version of our app that is publicly accessible. [Here](https://starfall-rebellion.vercel.app) you can find the deployment of the main branch. This is the version of the app that users will interact with, so it is important that it is always stable and up-to-date.

### Staging Branch

The staging branch is a testing environment for our app. This is where we can test new features and changes before they are deployed to the main branch. [Here](https://staging-starfall-rebellion.vercel.app) you can find the deployment of the staging branch. This environment allows us to catch any issues or bugs before they are visible to our users on production.
